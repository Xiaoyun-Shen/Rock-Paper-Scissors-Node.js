Rock–paper–scissors:
 
  1.The game is played between two players. The number of primes is three.
  2.Each player inputs one of three shapes from each terminal. These shapes are "rock","paper", and "scissors". 
  3.The result of the game is compared by the server after 3 rounds: 
	a player who decides to play rock will beat the other player who has chosen scissors ("rock crushes scissors"), but will lose to one who has played paper ("paper covers rock"); 
	a play of paper will lose to a play of scissors ("scissors cut paper"). 
	If both players choose the same shape, the game is tied.
